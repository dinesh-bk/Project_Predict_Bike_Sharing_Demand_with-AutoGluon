# Project Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon
The AutoGluon library had been utilized in this project to train multiple models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle. Tabular Prediction techniques were employed to fit data sourced from CSV files provided within the competition. This project had served as a demonstration of the individual's capability to utilize AutoGluon for training various iterations of models and documenting personal optimizations for the given problem.

The prediction of bike-sharing demand held significant relevance to companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, aligning with issues they regularly encounter. Predictive models not only assisted businesses in preparing for service surges but also contributed to enhancing customer experience by minimizing service delays.

Upon completion, several entries had been submitted to the competition, achieving a rank within Kaggle. Additionally, a report summarizing the findings had been compiled, serving as a public showcase of the work, shareable on Kaggle or personal platforms.
